# LHS712-Project
This is a class project aimed at analysising drug misuse/overdose from social media mentions. In the project, we took the Task 4 of SMM4H 2020 challenge(https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/smm4h/). We were given a test set and validation set composed of labeled tweets. We approached the problem with LightGBM and LSTM separately. LSTM achieved a better F-1 score.
